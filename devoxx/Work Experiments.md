- No clear vision -> Clear Direction
- Silos -> Cross team working

Find the bottlenecks, be Test driven

Clear Vision

- Awesome objectives

# Page Led meetings
- Intro - 5m
- Reading Time - 15m
- Discuss - 30m
- Actionable Next steps - 10m

What, Why, What does success look like. No more than a paragraph. Success clearly defined, not "we are more secure", too vague.

# Buddy system

# TL;DR docs
Could we do something like https://wowloretldr.com ?
